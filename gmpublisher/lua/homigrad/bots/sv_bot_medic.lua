	Tarkov AI - Self treatment

	Bots use Z-City's own medical items on themselves, standing or while
	ragdolled, and that decision feeds the retreat logic: breaking contact
	is worth a lot more when there is something to patch up with.

	Verified against the real items (lua/weapons):

	- Every medical item derives from weapon_bandage_sh /
	  weapon_hg_medicine_base and heals its OWN owner on IN_ATTACK
	  (SWEP:PrimaryAttack -> SWEP:Heal(owner)); IN_ATTACK2 heals whoever
	  the owner looks at. Only self-treatment is used here.
	- They all carry SWEP.WorkWithFake = true, so they work while downed
	  too - which is the case that actually matters, since bleeding out on
	  the floor is what kills. Switching weapons in a ragdoll needs
	  organism.canmove (weapons/homigrad_base/sv_fake.lua), so that is
	  checked before trying.
	- What each one is for, from the organism model:
	  * organism.arterialwounds - arterial bleeding. ONLY a tourniquet
	    (SWEP:Tourniquet) stops it, and it costs the limb's use. Highest
	    priority: it drains blood fastest.
	  * organism.wounds - ordinary bleeding, closed by bandages/medkits.
	  * organism.pain - over ~50 it halves ragdoll strength
	    (fake/sv_control.lua's power) and over 60 it adds disorientation.
	    Morphine/painkillers push it down.
	- Morphine overdoses: the item damages the user once more than one
	  full dose went into the same body (owner.injectedinto), so it's
	  pressed in short pulses with a long cooldown, never held down.

	The trigger is deliberately NOT "hurt at all": bandaging in the open
	while someone is shooting is how a bot dies holding gauze. Healing
	happens after contact is broken (the flee state hands over here), or
	while idle, or while down and not being looked at - except arterial
	bleeding, which is treated even under fire.
