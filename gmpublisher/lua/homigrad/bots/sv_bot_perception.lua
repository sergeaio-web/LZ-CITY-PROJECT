	Tarkov AI - Perception

	Sight + hearing layer for hg.bots. This file does NOT define a state -
	it runs underneath whatever state a bot is currently in, updating a
	shared "Memory" blackboard (bot.Bot.Memory) that state modules
	(combat/patrol/looting/flee) read from.

	Sight (reworked):
	- Two cones instead of one: a central cone (hg_bot_sight_fov) with full
	  range, and a much wider peripheral cone (hg_bot_sight_fov_peripheral)
	  with reduced range and much slower detection. Peripheral vision is
	  what makes a bot turn its head toward movement at the edge of view
	  instead of being blind one degree outside its cone.
	- Detection is ACCUMULATED, not instant (mem.Spot[ply] 0..1). A target
	  has to stay visible for a while before it is registered - faster up
	  close, in central vision, when sprinting, when firing, when the bot
	  is already alert; slower far away, in peripheral vision, crouched,
	  partially covered. A partially-filled meter makes the bot glance
	  toward the target (mem.GlancePos) - the "did something move there?"
	  moment - before it actually commits to a fight. A target that was
	  recently fought (or that shot at the bot) is re-acquired instantly.
	- LOS is tested against several body points (head/chest/legs, or the
	  ragdoll's bones for a downed target), so a player peeking only their
	  head, or lying behind a low wall, is handled correctly.
	- Both the bot's own ragdoll and the target's ragdoll are taken into
	  account. Previously a downed bot's LOS trace started inside its own
	  ragdoll head and always hit it (downed bots were effectively blind),
	  and a downed PLAYER was never "visible" because the trace hit their
	  ragdoll rather than the player entity.
	- Results are cached per bot/target for a few hundredths of a second:
	  combat, downed, hold and flee all call CanSee every tick, and without
	  the cache the same traces were being repeated several times per tick.

	Hearing (reworked):
	- hg.bots.ReportNoise(pos, radius, source, kind) - generic API. Noise
	  is muffled by walls (hg_bot_hearing_wall_mult), and the heard
	  position carries a distance-scaled error: a bot knows roughly where
	  a noise came from, not the exact spot.
	- Gunfire is reported straight from EntityFireBullets. Z-City's weapon
	  base plays gunshot sounds client-side, so EntityEmitSound on the
	  server never reliably saw real gunfire - bots were effectively deaf
	  to shots. Suppressors are respected.
	- Footsteps come from PlayerFootstep (running/walking/crouching have
	  different radii).
	- A noise made by the bot's CURRENT target updates the remembered
	  target position (mem.TargetPos / mem.LastHeard), which is what lets a
	  chasing bot follow someone around a corner by ear.

	Being shot at:
	- A bullet whose real path (traced to its actual impact point, so
	  walls stop it) passes near a bot, or impacts near it, counts as being
	  shot at: the shooter becomes the target, the rough shooter position
	  is estimated from the bullet line, and suppression builds up
	  (mem.Suppression, mem.UnderFireUntil, mem.UnderFireFrom). Combat and
	  downed logic use these to take cover / face the shooter instead of
	  running straight at an unseen gunman.
	- EntityTakeDamage also resolves damage dealt to a bot's RAGDOLL back
	  to the bot. Before, a downed bot never noticed being shot.

	Memory fields (all in bot.Bot.Memory):
		Target          - Entity or nil, current perceived threat
		TargetPos       - Vector, best estimate of the target's position
		TargetSeenPos   - Vector, exact position at last real sighting
		TargetVel       - Vector, target velocity at last sighting
		TargetVisible   - bool, visible on the last scan
		LastSeen        - CurTime() of last direct sight (or threat report)
		LastHeard       - CurTime() the target was last heard
		ContactHold     - CurTime() kept fresh by an active search (combat)
		Alertness       - 0 (unaware) .. 1 (fully alerted/engaged)
		SuspicionPos    - Vector or nil, "go check this out" noise ping
		SuspicionStrength - how convincing the current SuspicionPos is
		GlancePos/GlanceUntil - brief "look over there" from partial detection
		Spot            - [ply] = 0..1 detection meters
		Attackers       - [ply] = CurTime() of last shot/hit from them
		Suppression     - 0..1 incoming-fire pressure
		UnderFireUntil/UnderFireFrom - recent incoming fire and its origin
